Let's break down the code and explain what each part does:

Student.java
This is a simple Java class that represents a Student object.
It has two private fields: name and age, which are initialized through the constructor.
The toString() method is overridden to provide a string representation of the Student object.
University.java
This is the main class that demonstrates the Creator pattern.
It has three private fields:
name: the name of the university.
students: a list of Student objects created by the university.
The constructor initializes the name field and creates an empty list of students.
The createStudent method:
Takes two parameters: name and age.
Checks if the student is eligible to be created (i.Student.java

This is the main class that demonstrates the Creator pattern.
It has three private fields:

students: a list of Student objects created by the university.
The constructor initializes the name field and creates an empty list of students.
The createStudent method:
Takes two parameters: name and age.
Checks if the student is eligible to be created (i.e., if they are at least 18 years old).
If eligible, creates a new Student object and adds it to the students list.
Returns the created Student object or null if the student is not eligible.
The getStudents method returns the list of all created Student objects.
The main method:
Creates an instance of the University class.
Calls the createStudent method twice to create two students: John Doe (20 years old) and Jane Doe (17 years old).
Prints the created students to the console.
Prints the list of all created students to the console.e., if they are at least 18 years old).
If eligible, creates a new Student object and adds it to the students list.
Returns the created Student object or null if the student is not eligible.
The getStudents method returns the list of all created Student objects.

Prints the list of all created students to the console.
Key Concepts
Creator Pattern: The University class is responsible for creating Student objects, which is an example of the Creator pattern.
Encapsulation: The creation logic is encapsulated within the University class, making it easier to modify or extend.
Decoupling: The Student class is decoupled from the creation logic, making it easier to reuse or modify.
Improved Readability: The code is more readable, as the creation logic is clearly separated from the Student class.
